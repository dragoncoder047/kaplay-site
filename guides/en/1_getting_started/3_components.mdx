# Components

Components are the building blocks of game objects. They define the behavior of
the object, like how it moves, how it looks, and how it interacts with other
objects.

## What is a Component?

A component is a piece of code that defines a specific behavior of a game
object.

It returns a set of **properties** and **methods** that are attached to the game
object.

```js
// pos() component gives the object the .pos prop, and .move() method
const player = add([pos(80, 80)]);

player.move(100, 0); // move the player 100 pixels to the right, this is a method
console.log(player.pos); // { x: 180, y: 80 }, this is a property
```

There are a lot of useful components in KAPLAY like:

- [`sprite()`](/doc/ctx/sprite) to make the object draw an image, and play
  animations
- [`area()`](/doc/ctx/area) to make the object do collision detection, with
  methods like [`onCollide()`](/doc/AreaComp#AreaComp-onCollide)
- [`rect()`](/doc/ctx/rect) to make the object draw a simple rectangle shape
- [`text()`](/doc/ctx/text) to make the object draw text
- [`scale()`](/doc/ctx/scale) to make the game object bigger or smaller or to
  stretch it

You can see all the components in the [API Reference](/doc/ctx/pos).

## Components operations

### How to add components

```js
loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png");

// Add the component on creation
const bean = add([
    sprite("bean"), // bean the frog :D
    opacity(0.6), // a ghost bean???
]);

// Add the component after creation
bean.use(color("#ff00ff")); // green bean <:
```

### How to remove components

```js
// We pass the component name for remove it.
bean.unuse("sprite"); // bye bean
```

### How to know if a game object have a component

```js
// We pass the component name:
bean.has("sprite"); // false - true if comp is there, otherwise false
```

<Info crew="gun" title="Important!">
Do note that you can't pass the component itself to `.unuse()` / `.has()`,
you have to pass the component _name_!
</Info>

## Making your own components

If you are creating a larger game, it's probably a good idea to bundle some of
your game's functionality into custom components. You can check out how to do
that in [this guide](/guides/custom_components/).
