## About

**KAPLAY** (_/ˈkæpleɪ/_) is a **JavaScript** library that helps you make games
**fast** and **fun**! With an easy API and a focus on **games**, you can create
games **quickly** without writing many lines of code.

**KAPLAYGROUND** is the official playground of KAPLAY, where you can test our
examples and learn how to use KAPLAY.

## Features

- Creation of levels using ASCII maps.
- An ECS (Entity Component System) architecture.
- A powerful event system.
- Arcade physics, fast and simple.
- A bunch of examples to get you started quickly
  [here](https://play.kaplayjs.com).
- A large community of developers who creates plugins and share them with the
  community on our official Discord.
- Fully compatible with Kaboom.js 3000.

## The backstory

On _21 May 2024_ we took the decision to create this spiritual successor of
**Kaboom.js**, being also a fork of it.

This was due to Kaboom.js being abandoned by Replit, the original creator of
Kaboom.js, and the community was left without a maintainer.

The idea is to expand what kaboom was under a new identity, **KAPLAY** itself is
fully compatible with Kaboom.

## Logos, names and other assets

The name is **KAPLAY**, a play on the word "kaboom" and the word "play", it's
written in all caps, **KAPLAY**, not **KaPlay** or **Kaplay**. Anyway **kaplay**
(lowercase) is also acceptable.
